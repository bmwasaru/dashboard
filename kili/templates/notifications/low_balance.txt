Hello,

Your current balance ({{ current_balance }}) has dipped below the {{ passed_limit }} threshold required to allocate new cloud resources.

Until the account balance is raised, you may notice services starting to turn off. Please maintain a sufficient balance for your usage so we can keep everything working for you.

If you have any questions or concerns, please email us at help@kili.io.

Thanks,
The Kili Team
